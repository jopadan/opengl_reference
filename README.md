opengl_reference
================

This is going to be a repository of modern (3.3/4.x) OpenGL programs.
Most of these will be either exploring/demonstrating concepts or
be framework/template programs for starting new projects.

There are better repositories of modern OpenGL programs to
use for learning because they're more complete/organized,
they go with a book etc.  However, this is mostly for my own
personal use/code and will be constantly changing.  Writing
a bunch of OpenGL programs will also force me to learn glm
and finish my own OpenGL math/helper code.


I'll maintain a table/list of programs here

| Program | Description | Image |

| ex1.cpp | Hello Triangle                                          | ![ex1](./media/screenshots/ex_1.png) |
| ex2.cpp | Hello Interpolation                                     | ![ex2](./media/screenshots/ex_2.png) |
| ex3.cpp | Switch between gouraud and Phong shading                | ![ex3](./media/screenshots/ex_3.png) |
| ex4.cpp | Switch between textures, filtering modes                | ![ex4](./media/screenshots/ex_4.png) |
| flying.cpp | Template with 6DOF flying controls ala Descent                     | ![flying](./media/screenshots/flying.png) |
